This repository showcases selected remote-executed projects combining mechanical engineering, manufacturing operations, and data analysis. The work emphasizes clear documentation, asynchronous collaboration, and measurable outcomes — the same skills required for effective remote engineering roles.

What You’ll Find Here:
  1) Manufacturing task tracker Dashboard (Python / SQL / Flask)
  2) Decision-Support Tool (curated news) to parse keywords and regularly keep stakeholders aware of happenings(Python / Outlook Email)

Project Details:
1) Task Tracker
   Goal: Identify bottlenecks and downtime drivers in a production environment, rightly anticipate completion dates based on resource loading

Tools: Python, SQL, Pandas, numpy, PostgreSQL
What I Did:
Designed ERD and data schema for machine output log
Built SQL queries to aggregate downtime and throughput metrics
Created dashboard to support daily production decisions

2) Curated News
   Goal: Help non-technical stakeholders be more aware of whats happening. (this was tested on a public news website to simulate intranet news and parse for key words that might be of interest for leaders)

Tools: Python, SQL, BeautifulSoup, Alembic
What I Did:
Translated raw website data into email newsletter
Documented assumptions and limitations based on list of interests from stakeholder
